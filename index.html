    <h3> Watching documentaries</h3>

    <p> Watching documentaries is my favorite hobby because it helps me learn about real-life events, people, and places in an interesting way.
   This hobby expands my knowledge. <b> It keeps me informed about different topics such as history, technology, and culture.</b>
  Documentaries allow me to see the world from different perspectives
  <i>I enjoy this hobby because it is both educational and enjoyable</i> and it helps me stay curious and aware of what is happening around the world.
